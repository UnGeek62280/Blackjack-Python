# Blackjack-Python
A blackjack made with python by a student, without a graphic interface
I'm a student in a technical degree in "IT"
Here's a blackjack I created, if you could give me some advice
as to how I could improve my code, and as to how I could
improve my skill.
Thx for reading, have a nice day
